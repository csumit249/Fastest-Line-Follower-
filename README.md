# Fastest-Line-Follower-
Build your own autonomous robot within the specified dimensions to achieve the maximum speed to beat other robots on the given track and reach the destination in minimum time. The robot must start behind the starting point and is considered to have crossed the finishing line if any part of the robot crosses it in a full lap of the course. The robot must follow the black line. The competition area has a special place defined for the robot’s operation.

## GamePlay
Knockout Round: In this round two teams will compete one-on-one starting at the same time, the team finishing the race in the minimum time will qualify for the Final round.

Final Round:  Qualified teams will compete in this round to achieve the minimum runtime. Single run will be conducted for each qualified team. Teams with the minimum runtime will be nominated as the winner of the competition.

Race clock: The race clock begins as soon as the robot crosses the starting point and ends when the robot reaches the finishing line without any fail.
Runtime: The robot must traverse the full track from the starting point to the finishing point in a single run at least once for each round within the maximum access time (5 minutes). This runtime will be the official runtime for the team.
Pre-Game setup: Before starting the competition, each team will get 10 mins to calibrate the robot and make a trial/testing runs. All the preparations must be done during this time (adjusting the sensors, reprogramming the robot etc).
Game Zone: An area around the field will be designated as the GAME ZONE. No one is allowed inside the game zone except the robot handlers and the referees.
Start and Restarts:

Only the team Leader will be allowed to handle the robot during the gameplay.
The robot will be placed at the starting point with the consent of the referee.
A robot may restart the run if the person handling it feels the necessity. A restart can be requested only if the robot doesn’t follow the line, has stopped on half way or has lost the directions/Black line.
At any restart, the robot must be re-positioned back at the start point.
It is not allowed to reprogram the robot or to add/remove parts on the robot during the run, but adjusting the sensors is permissible with the consent of the referee.
The RACE CLOCK/RUN TIME will reset to zero on every restart. The COMPETITION CLOCK (maximum access time) will keep running during all restarts.
Only 3 restarts are allowed for each round.
A robot must restart if:

The robot does not start after pressing the Start Button for 1 minute.
The robot is touched by a human without the consent of the referee.
The robot moves out of the arena.
The referee orders to restart.
